                                <p>If you take a little wander through South Campus, you’ll come across a college that
                                    shines like the pyre of a thousand phoenixes, illuminated by myth, power, and value.
                                    Congratulations, you are now a part of the rust and gold glory that is Will Rice
                                    College, the second college founded at Rice University! You may first notice that we
                                    have a dazzling outdoor quad flanked on three sides by our spectacular New Dorm, our
                                    stunningly historic Old Dorm, and the coziest commons on campus. It is inside,
                                    though,
                                    that you will truly get to experience the welcoming and warm spirit of your new Will
                                    Rice family.</p>

                                <p>Originally built in 1912, Old Dorm (known then as South Hall) was the first
                                    residential
                                    building on campus. Will Rice College was founded in 1957 and named after William
                                    Marsh
                                    Rice Junior, the nephew of Rice’s founder. Beginning as a college of about 200
                                    members,
                                    Will Rice was given the motto “The College of Individuals” by James Street Fulton.
                                    In
                                    1977, Will Rice became a co-ed college and adopted the name of “The College of Gods
                                    and
                                    Goddesses” instead. It was during this time that Will Rice developed its victorious
                                    culture. From 1960-1968, Will Rice dominated Songfest, the university’s prestigious
                                    annual chorale competition, to the point that the university decided to cancel the
                                    competition due to Will Rice’s endless winning streak. Since then, Will Rice has
                                    claimed victory in freshman flag football, the Presidents’ Cup Tournament, and most
                                    famously, Beer Bike!</p>

                                <p>Started in 1957, Beer Bike is an annual competitive bike race hosted by Rice in the
                                    spring. Starting from the Monday of Beer Bike Week, Will Ricers passionately fill
                                    water balloons, plan jacks (pranks) against other colleges, and practice chugging
                                    and biking until the day of the race. Will Rice has taken pride in winning countless
                                    Beer Bike races and being the only college to sweep the alumni, women’s, and men’s
                                    races not just once, but 5 times!</p>

                                <p>However, Will Rice isn’t all about competition. While winning is fun, Will Rice has
                                    always been about doing things, whether racing or studying, together. As one of the
                                    oldest colleges, our culture is rooted in tradition, with a phoenix spirit that is
                                    open to rebirth and change. Over time, Will Rice has introduced new traditions to
                                    its
                                    culture such as Whale Day, KITQs, and Phinest Phoenix. Along with its formal
                                    traditions, Will Rice has also developed more laid-back rituals such as late night
                                    studying in the commons, playing Smash in the game room, watching cheesy reality TV
                                    with the RAs, and having daily lunch announcements.</p>

                                <p>Will Ricers take initiative. Our student government, affectionately nicknamed EC
                                    (Executive Council), meets weekly in the Magister’s House to discuss what’s going
                                    on at Will Rice. Everyone, regardless of elected position, is encouraged to attend
                                    to hear the latest on Will Rice, make a proposal for a grilled cheese party, or even
                                    just come for the friends! Everyone is encouraged to get involved, and there truly
                                    is
                                    something for everyone. Each matriculating class of Will Ricers shapes our college’s
                                    trajectory for the better, and we cannot wait to see what new values, traditions,
                                    and
                                    perspectives you’ll bring to the table. Like the mythical phoenix that serves as the
                                    symbol of the college, Will Rice rises above the others, burning with a bright fire
                                    and
                                    passion. We take pride in our history and work every day as a college to grow
                                    together,
                                    becoming the best versions of ourselves with each new reincarnation.</p>
