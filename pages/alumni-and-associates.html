            <h1>Associates</h1>
            <p> Will Rice has an extensive network of faculty, alumni, and community mentors called Associates. They help students find new opportunities for growth outside of campus via volunteering, field trips, and common interest activities. Furthermore, Associates have a chance to participate in Rice’s unique college system and make lasting connections with current students. If you are interested in becoming an Associate, please contact Dale Thomas at <a href="mailto:wrc@rice.edu">wrc@rice.edu</a>).

				<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Academy of Fellows here at Rice. I completed a PhD in the history and theory of architecture at MIT, where I also served as a resident tutor in an undergrad dorm for six years. I study the relationship between war, violence, and cities in the 20th century, with a focus on global and racial ideologies. I have lived and studied in Germany, New Zealand, Scotland, England, as well as Japan, where I was working as a ski instructor when I decided to go to grad school (life works in mysterious ways sometimes). I ride my bike as much as I can, and generally like being active—going for long walks/hikes, hot yoga, and skating around the bayou are some favorites. Given my field of study, I really love art, architecture, and travel. I’ve also spent many years talking with students about grad school and career choices, so don’t be shy and reach out if you ever need a sounding board. I look forward to being a resource to Will Rice! </p>
