                <p> Will Rice has an extensive network of faculty, alumni, and community mentors called Associates. They
                    help students find new opportunities for growth outside of campus via volunteering, field trips, and
                    common interest activities. Furthermore, Associates have a chance to participate in Rice’s unique
                    college system and make lasting connections with current students. If you are interested in becoming
                    an
                    Associate, please contact Sheren Brunson at <a href="mailto:wrc@rice.edu">wrc@rice.edu</a>.

                    Spain.  Maria also studied in Milan and Florence, Italy, and Michele in London, UK, and they both
                    spent several years in Mexico City—so it’s no surprise that these two continue to enjoy traveling
                    and exploring different cultures together!  Besides travel, Michele enjoys biking, reading, and
                    cooking.  Maria likes photography, dancing, and eating the food cooked by Michele.</p>

                    German 1987, Hanszen College), I earned my PhD in History in 1994 at the University of
                    Michigan and began teaching at Rice in 2003. For more information on academic stuff, see my
                    faculty page at https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/lora-wildenthal.
                    I am to be found most Tuesday nights in the Will Rice Commons, holding office hours 6-8pm
                    during the academic year. I am up for kimchi making (we’ve done that a few times in the Will
                    Rice kitchen), talking about students’ postgraduate plans, and anything else that students
                    would like to discuss. I love classical music concerts, especially chamber music, and I am always
                    up for restaurant trips. In the summer, I like to travel to Germany and Mexico, and to read all
                    kinds of stuff. Recently, I’ve been focusing on books frequently banned in Texas public and
                    school libraries, and so far I can highly recommend them!</p>

                    Rice in ECE right before becoming faculty here. He (quite literally) enjoys long walks, e.g., two hours, 
                    and is obsessed with NHK's Japanology Plus hosted by Peter Barakan. He additionally enjoys reading books 
                    that are considered boring by many, and has truly been inspired by the life-giving fountains of 
                    anime and Korean dramas.</p>

                <p>While growing up in Kansas, Jon thought that he would get a job working in information technology and
                    spend the rest of his life happily sitting alone at a computer. Once he had completed a Computer
                    Science degree from Kansas State University and several years in the IT industry, Jon realized that
                    a future in technology without significant interaction with other people was quickly becoming his
                    own private hell. After a short dalliance with managerial roles (and an MBA from KSU), Jon found the
                    love of his life: teaching. He began a PhD in Organizational Behavior from Michigan State
                    University. During his pre-PhD life, Jon held such varied roles as Comic Book Store Owner, UNIX
                    Systems Administrator, Project Manager, and Statistics Instructor. Despite top-notch training in OB
                    research (and much to the chagrin of his professors), Jon chose to turn away from a research-based
                    life and pursue a career as a teaching-focused professor. He spent three years at the University of
                    Cincinnati, creating, teaching, and managing an undergraduate course on professionalism and ethics
                    before moving on to Rice Business in the summer of 2018. He loves creating interactive classrooms,
                    where students work together with the instructor to teach each other and experience the material
                    directly through personal stories and classroom exercises. </p>

                    she did whatever she could to serve the community, including serving as a Diversity

                    Center, and tour guide. After she graduated from Rice, she worked as a medical scribe and 
                    obtained her M.S. in Medical Science from the University of North Texas. Even though she 
                    appreciated her experience in the medical field, she wanted a career change and found 
                    college admissions! She currently works as an admission counselor in Rice’s Office of Admission. 
                    When she is on campus, you can find her at Lovett Hall, Coffeehouse (her favorite coffee shop!), 
                    or the inner loop on a walk. If you see her, feel free to stop by and say hello! She loves talking 
                    to students about any topic, but especially music (she is a BTS ARMY!), films, makeup, and food. She 
                    is so excited to be a WRC Associate and see y’all around campus and at the WRC commons for

                <p>I'm a WRC alum from the Class of 2017. During my time at Rice I was involved in as much as possible:
                    I was an O-Week and Head PAA, an Academic Fellow, a captain of the Women's D1 Swim Team, and served
                    as the Vice President on the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee...among other things. I loved every
                    second of my time at Rice, and to this day have never gotten tired of making sure everyone knows
                    which college is the best. After finishing my Master's degree in International Development and
                    Project Management at Sciences Po University in Paris, France, I came straight back to Houston where
                    I proceeded to get involved with Rice again immediately - I now work at Rice, I am a WRC Associate
                    and a member of the R Association Board. I love chatting with the current Will Ricers, so don't
                    hesitate to reach out or come and talk to me at Associates' events! </p>

                <p>I am the Managing Director of Indus Management Group.  We are a property and asset management company
                    that specializes in the multifamily housing market. IMG has a portfolio of 21 apartment complexes
                    consisting of approximately 6000 apartment units in the Houston market, specifically specializing in
                    the Southwest Houston sub-market.  I graduated from Rice in 2005 with a BA in History, and got an MD
                    in 2011.  I opted out of going to residency and made a career switch, taking me to where I am now. 
                    My favorite thing to do on a Saturday morning is to play video games.  I build my own gaming
                    computers and I might have a slight obsession with board games as well.  Some of my favorite are

                <p>Born at a young age, Bill Tanner came to Rice in 1990 and graduated with a BS in Mechanical
                    Engineering in '94.  In order to avoid the real world a bit longer, he stuck around to earn his
                    Masters in Mechanical Engineering in '95.  During his time at Rice he was involved in the Cascade
                    Juggling Club, KTRU, the Mob, and the Rice Players (among other things).  He always meant to do a
                    comic strip for the Thresher, but settled on doing t-shirt designs and even came up with the 90's
                    re-design of Sammy the Owl.  He currently works at Schlumberger as a Solution Architect and enjoys
                    drawing, playing ukulele, and spending time with his family in his spare time.  He was lucky enough
                    to meet his wife Jean (Hanszen '88) after they both had been out of Rice for a while, so they're
                    doing their part to prop up that particular myth.    </p>

                <p>Of all the titles I use to describe myself, Will Rice Alum and Associate are my favorites.  
                    I was a WRC advisor in 2000 and Beer Bike coordinator in 2001 (so that will tell you how long I've been around). 
                    Ask me about our Will Rice legends like Doc C, Babs our long-time College Coordinator, 
                    Magisters Dale and Elise and about the time Will Rice Swept in 1998. I majored in Psych, 
                    Spanish and Premed and today I'm a physician assistant/associate in General Internal Medicine 
                    at Baylor Medicine. I see patients every day and lecture/precept Physician Assistant students 
                    at our top-ranked school.  I love jogging around the Rice outer loop, practicing my very poor 
                    Portuguese and French, relaxing with my cat Doxy and trying different wines from across the world.  </p>

                <p>As a Will Rice 2012 graduate, I am so happy to be a Will Rice Associate. During my time at Rice, 
                    I was a Chief Justice, a Rice Health Advisor, and founded Karma Patrol (now known as Caregiving). 
                    I studied abroad in Australia and also went to Peru and Guatemala on a Lowenstern Fellowship and 
                    ISP, respectively! If any of these experiences are of interest, I'll be happy to share! I was also 
                    a recipient of the Salman Khan Commencement Award for Educational Entrepreneurship at Rice University 
                    for my work in education domestically and abroad.

                    After receiving a B.A. in Political Science, I continued teaching through Teach for America as a 2012 Corps Member. 
                    I earned the Beginning Teacher of the Year distinction for the Houston Independent School District, became social 
                    studies department chair, and served as the Director of the College and Career Center at Sharpstown High School.
            
                    One of the coolest things I've done was spend a year in Asia on a Fulbright Fellowship 
                    to work with local teachers to deliver robust English curricula and study the ways the 
                    East incorporates social-emotional learning in school culture and instruction.
                    
                    I am a Senior Fellow of the American Leadership Forum Class LIV and serve as a co-facilitator 
                    for American Leadership Forum. I was also selected as a 2023 Houston Business Journal's 40 Under 
                    40 Honoree. My partner, Jon, and I love baking cakes and having board game nights with our friends!</p>

                <h5> Gilbert Cuthbertson "Doc C" </h5>
                <p>
                    Gilbert Cuthbertson was a legendary Will Rice RA, aka Doc C. First of all, Doc was an amazing
                    storyteller, and he had a story for every occasion. Most of his stories were about former Will Rice
                    students - that’s because he was involved for more than 50 years! His favorite activities included
                    hunting down bargains, buying things on eBay, being the WRC legendary card shark (bridge and liar’s
                    poker are his personal favorites), teaching his outstanding and entertaining political science
                    classes, schooling freshmen in the gameroom, and greeting Will Rice students with a warm smile and
                    emphatic “No problem!”. You can’t help but be entertained by some of the stories he has to share.
                    Doc was the most pro-Rice and pro-Will Rice person you could meet.
