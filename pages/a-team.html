            <h1> College Magisters </h1>
            <h2> Bridget, Mike, and Frankie </h2>
            <a href="mailto:bkgorman@rice.edu"><h4>bkgorman@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p> Think about the Harry Potter analogy: Professor McGonagall is to Gryffindor as Professor Snape is
                to Slytherin as College Magisters are to Residential Colleges. At Rice, College Magisters are tenured
                professors and their spouses entrusted with being the faculty leaders of any given college. Along with
                living next to the college with their families in a magister's house (the Will Rice Magister's House is
                right next to New Dorm), college magisters help the college to accomplish its shared goals, solve
                challenges, celebrate its communal achievements, and most of all, be a voice of experience when needed.
                <br><br>
                We are lucky enough at Will Rice to have Bridget Gorman and Mike Reed as our magisters. Let's have a
                look at just how awesome they are:
                <br><br>
                Bridget Gorman is professor and chair of the sociology department. She is beginning her 15th year at
                Rice, and has been actively involved in the residential college system the entire time. She teaches
                undergrad courses on medical sociology and research methods, and during the day you can often find her
                in her office, hunkered over a computer and running statistical models for her research. Originally from
                Seattle, Washington, she has lived all over the country for her studies and research and has amassed a
                giant collection of board and card games (which you are welcome to borrow). Most importantly, she has
                mad baking skills, and you will be the fortunate benefactor of her famous cookies.
                <br><br>
                Mike Reed is a native Houstonian who received a BA from the University of Houston in literature. He is
                the owner/operator of a small, niche party rental company, and during the week can often be found
                working in his office at the magisters' house, playing with Frankie (their nine month old daughter), or
                walking his two dogs, Steve McQueen and Alabama.
                <br><br>
                Bridget and Mike will always lend a helping hand and a listening ear when you need them for advice and
                assistance with academics, social issues, personal problems, or just life in general. They will assist
                every student in making the most of the academic and social opportunities available at Rice, and
                especially Will Rice. Over the coming years, Bridget and Mike will be your allies and guides in planning
                and preparing your life throughout college and for your world after your Rice years are over.

            <p> 
                Hi! I'm Casey, I am beyond excited to be the new College Coordinator at Will Rice. I will be one of the first people you meet on move-in day, as I handle all things regarding your room and mailbox keys. During the year though, think of me as your “one-stop-shop.” I handle your mail, notify you when you have a package, sell you a stamp (and if necessary, show you where on the envelope to put it), I have aspirin and band-aids, and you can make copies, scan documents and send faxes.
                <br><br>
                I am here for YOU and happy to answer your questions and help make sense of all that comes with being a student at Rice. If there is anything you need help with, come see me and if I don’t know the answer, I will find someone who does!
                <br><br>
                Come by my office, have some candy, chill, have a cup of tea (no joke), vent about the test you just took, or talk about the kind of day you’ve had.
                <br><br>
                - Casey

            <a href="mailto:Tami.L.Andrew@rice.edu"><h4>Tami.L.Andrew@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p> 
                Tami and Jacob (Jake) are super excited to be RAs and can’t wait to share their enthusiasm for WRC and Rice with you. They are looking forward to supporting you throughout your college experience at Will Rice with their two lovable cats and dog, their plethora of video games, and their home-cooked Italian cuisine.
                <br><br>
                When not at Will Rice, Tami and Jacob can be found at Anderson Hall hanging out with the Archies, where Tami works as the Graphic Designer and Event Coordinator for the Architecture Department and where Jacob studies his way through graduate school for his Masters in Architecture.
                <br><br>
                Before moving to Houston in 2012, this dynamic duo (both originally from the tri-state) met in New Jersey after college when Jacob went in search of a pool table in Jersey City but found the love of his life instead. They bonded over their shared passion for rare and unusual literature and eventually moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico for a few years where Tami received her M.F.A. in Photography at UNM.
                <br><br>
                Tami and Jacob are (almost annoyingly) excited to plan a slew of events to get to know you and let you get to know them. From Pixar Movie Nights to Geocaching picnics, they are here to help make your college experience everything you want it to be by being there for the casual conversation to the ‘I-just-need-to-pet-a-cat-and-watch-amovie- in-order-to-feel-normal’ sort of situations. They are very excited to meet you and know that you’ll love it here at Will Rice!

            <p> 
                I’m your newest RA, Gwen. You might recognize me as Dr. Bradford from your philosophy class – I’m a professor in the philosophy department where I teach classes and do research in ethics, value, the meaning of life, and other such things. I first came to Rice in 2010, and 2015 is my first year as RA at Will Rice.
                <br><br>
                If you’ve got an existential crisis or want to mull over the meaning of life, you know where to turn. I’m also here to help you navigate the ups and downs of academic life – how to manage your time, deal with a heavy reading load, or decide what classes to take, or, more generally, how to adult. Admittedly, I’m still figuring out this last thing myself, but at least we’re all in it together.
                <br><br>
                When I’m not at Rice, I’m jogging in Hermann Park, or coffee-shop hopping, or heading out to enjoy the Houston Grand Opera … and when I’m done all that I’m around figuring out just how crafty you need to be to make a craft cocktail, or how to brew the best coffee, or looking for excuses to make banana bread and share it with you.

            <p> 
                Gilbert Cuthbertson is a legendary Will Rice RA, aka Doc C. First of all, Doc is an amazing storyteller, and he has a story for every occasion. Most of his stories are about former Will Rice students - that’s because he’s been involved for more than 50 years! His favorite activities include hunting down bargains, buying things on eBay, being the WRC legendary card shark (bridge and liar’s poker are his personal favorites), teaching his outstanding and entertaining political science classes, schooling freshmen in the gameroom, and greeting Will Rice students with a warm smile and emphatic “No problem!”. You can’t help but be entertained by some of the stories he has to share. Doc is the most pro-Rice and pro-Will Rice person you will meet, so he will do his best as an RA to make your experience at Rice and Will Rice as positive as possible.

                    <p>Tami and Jacob (Jake) are super excited to be RAs and can’t wait to share their enthusiasm for
                        WRC and Rice with you. They are looking forward to supporting you throughout your college
                        experience at Will Rice with their two lovable cats and dog, their plethora of video games, and
                        their home-cooked Italian cuisine.<br>
                        <br>
                        When not at Will Rice, Tami and Jacob can be found at Anderson Hall hanging out with the
                        Archies, where Tami works as the Graphic Designer and Event Coordinator for the Architecture
                        Department and where Jacob studies his way through graduate school for his Masters in
                        Architecture.<br>
                        <br>
                        Before moving to Houston in 2012, this dynamic duo (both originally from the tri-state) met in
                        New Jersey after college when Jacob went in search of a pool table in Jersey City but found the
                        love of his life instead. They bonded over their shared passion for rare and unusual literature
                        and eventually moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico for a few years where Tami received her M.F.A.
                        in Photography at UNM.<br>
                        <br>
                        Tami and Jacob are (almost annoyingly) excited to plan a slew of events to get to know you and
                        let you get to know them. From Pixar Movie Nights to Geocaching picnics, they are here to help
                        make your college experience everything you want it to be by being there for the casual
                        conversation to the ‘I-just-need-to-pet-a-cat-and-watch-amovie- in-order-to-feel-normal’ sort of
                        situations. They are very excited to meet you and know that you’ll love it here at Will Rice!
