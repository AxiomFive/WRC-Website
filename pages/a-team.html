            <h2> Matt and Rebekah </h2>
            <a href="mailto:Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu"><h4>Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p>
                We are Matthew and Rebekah Bennett, Magisters of Will Rice
                College. Will Rice College is a unique place within a unique
                university. It will be your home for the next four years and a
                central part of your life at the university.
            <br><br>
                Our roles as Magisters: The most formal instruction we
                ever received for being Magisters was: “Just be there.” That
                means we live with you (or rather in a house next to your
                dorms), eat with you in the commons, root you on at events
                (Beer Bike!), applaud your accomplishments, give you
                advice, challenge you academically, play foosball with you,
                champion your future, and become your friends. We’ll be
                there for the good times and bad, and will strive to make
                your time here enjoyable, productive, and fulfilling. As
                Magisters, we are the heads of the college – but don’t let
                that fool you. You, the students, are the true leaders of the
                college and you will shape it as much as it shapes you. We
                see our role as being primarily advisory – helping to steer
                the college to achieve its goals and maintain its tradition of excellence.
            <br><br>
                About us: Both of us are originally from Michigan, but have
                lived all over the country before settling in Houston in 2009
                when Matt joined the Rice faculty. We have two children,
                Jacob and Marisol, and two cats, Sasha and
                Phoenix. Rebekah, who attended Emory University and
                Georgetown Law School, is a lawyer who specializes in labor
                & employment law and corporate political activities law. She
                is currently the General Counsel of the ExxonMobil
                Pipeline Company. Rebekah loves baking, movies, travel,
                and reading. Matt is an associate professor in the
                Department of Biosciences. He attended the University of
                Michigan and received his Ph.D. in physics from Georgia
                Tech. His research aims to develop synthetic microbes for
                medical and industrial applications. Matt, an avid Detroit
                Red Wings fan, enjoys gaming, playing cards, hiking, and
                crappy science fiction.
            <br><br>
                Our foremost goal is to help you achieve your academic and
                social goals here at the university. If we can help in any way,
                just let us know!

                I’m Sheren, the Will Rice College Coordinator. I am the newest member of the A-Team, although I have
                been at Rice for some time, and the only one who doesn’t live on campus. I have regular office hours
                (M-F 9-5) and I receive and sort your mail and packages. If you have any questions – about anything,
                really, my office is a good place to start. If I can’t answer your question, I will direct you to the
                person who can. You can also stop by to chat, grab a piece of candy, get tape, send a letter and lots
                of other stuff. I am genuinely curious about people so if you stop by, I will definitely ask a question
                or two.
                <br><br>
                I’m originally from South Carolina, where I earned a B.A. in Anthropology from University of SC
                (GO GAMECOCKS!!), I’m a Returned Peace Corp Volunteer (Huedin, Romania 2000-2002), and I got a M.A.
                in International Affairs from The New School in NYC, where I lived for 12 years before moving back
                to the south and landing in Houston. I love taking care of my plants, hanging out with Ms. Bootsy,
                listening to the radio and keeping up with current events. With that said, I ask — How can I help?
                Come Through!!!

            <p>
                Hey Will Rice! I’m the Old Dorm RA and I’m so excited to be part of this community. 
                My roomies are my 12 year old dog Cleo and my 2 year old cat Lucy. My day job is 
                Assistant Director of RISE at Rice, a program in SSI which supports underrepresented 
                students in social sciences and humanities majors. My degrees are in human development 
                and education and I love working with students, and especially helping you find 
                community and connections when being a student starts to feel intimidating and 
                overwhelming. It is a privilege to be a small part of your journeys! 
                <br><br>
                When I’m not at work, I love to cook, ride my bike through Buffalo Bayou, care for 
                my growing plant collection and on a nice day you might find me outside reading a 
                cheesy romance novel. I’m a Houston native and love living in town close to my 
                family, especially my niece and nephew, who you might also see around the dorm! 
                Cleo, Lucy and I can’t wait to chat get to know you and help make Will Rice home 
                for you.

            <a href="mailto:Sandra.V.Parsons@rice.edu"><h4>Sandra.V.Parsons@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p>
                Sandy is on the faculty in the
                Department of Psychological Sciences and has been hanging around
                Will Rice as an associate for about 8 years. Sandy loves being an RA
                because she can spend even more time with the students over meals,
                musical performances, athletic events, and whatever else they want to
                do. Sandy has monthly study breaks called “StOp and GrOw” where
                we all hang out and take some time to reflect on what we are doing
                and why. Will is a pediatric oncologist at Texas Children’s Hospital and
                Baylor where he is the Deputy Director of Cancer and Hematology.
                <br><br>
                Sandy and Will love poke bowls, bubble tea, chocolate chip cookies,
                and their French Bulldog. They can almost always be found
                walking the dog in the quad after dinner and will talk endlessly
                about their dog if you are ever at a loss about how to start a
                conversation with them.
