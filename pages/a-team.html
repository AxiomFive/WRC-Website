            <h2> Matt and Rebekah </h2>
            <a href="mailto:Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu"><h4>Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p>
                We are Matthew and Rebekah Bennett, Magisters of Will Rice
                College. Will Rice College is a unique place within a unique
                university. It will be your home for the next four years and a
                central part of your life at the university.
            <br><br>
                Our roles as Magisters: The most formal instruction we
                ever received for being Magisters was: “Just be there.” That
                means we live with you (or rather in a house next to your
                dorms), eat with you in the commons, root you on at events
                (Beer Bike!), applaud your accomplishments, give you
                advice, challenge you academically, play foosball with you,
                champion your future, and become your friends. We’ll be
                there for the good times and bad, and will strive to make
                your time here enjoyable, productive, and fulfilling. As
                Magisters, we are the heads of the college – but don’t let
                that fool you. You, the students, are the true leaders of the
                college and you will shape it as much as it shapes you. We
                see our role as being primarily advisory – helping to steer
                the college to achieve its goals and maintain its tradition of excellence.
            <br><br>
                About us: Both of us are originally from Michigan, but have
                lived all over the country before settling in Houston in 2009
                when Matt joined the Rice faculty. We have two children,
                Jacob (age 7) and Marisol (age 4) and two cats, Sasha and
                Phoenix. Rebekah, who attended Emory University and
                Georgetown Law School, is a lawyer who specializes in labor
                & employment law and corporate political activities law. She
                is currently the General Counsel of the ExxonMobil
                Pipeline Company. Rebekah loves baking, movies, travel,
                and reading. Matt is an associate professor in the
                Department of Biosciences. He attended the University of
                Michigan and received his Ph.D. in physics from Georgia
                Tech. His research aims to develop synthetic microbes for
                medical and industrial applications. Matt, an avid Detroit
                Red Wings fan, enjoys gaming, playing cards, hiking, and
                crappy science fiction.
            <br><br>
                Our foremost goal is to help you achieve your academic and
                social goals here at the university. If we can help in any way,
                just let us know!

            <a href="mailto:@email-coordinator"><h4>@email-coordinator</h4></a>
            <p> 
                Hi! I’m Dale, and I am College Coordinator at Will Rice. I have been connected to 
                Rice for as long as I can remember and in several different ways, including long 
                ago as a Magisters’ kid and more recently as the mom of two Rice undergrads. Professionally, 
                my background is in elementary teaching, but when I moved back to Houston after 11 years 
                living outside of London, I decided I was ready for a change, and I’ve loved taking on a 
                different role and working with older students at Will Rice.
                <br><br>
                Unlike the rest of the A-Team, I don’t live in the college, so I head home at
                night to any of my four big kids who happen to be around, our aloof cats,
                and a blissfully happy rescue dog. If you were to peek in our windows, you
                might spy us watching a rom-com, playing online trivia, or spontaneously performing
                a show tune in our kitchen. Or we might just be doing the dishes or napping on the
                couch. 
                <br><br>
                Over the course of the year, I’m here to help
                and support you in whatever way you need. Whether you’re looking for a
                vacuum cleaner, directions to a professor’s office, or a registration form,
                my office is a good place to start. Probably the most important part of my
                job—and certainly the part I enjoy the most—is providing a place for you
                to sit down, see a friendly face, grab a piece of candy, vent about a test,
                parent, or roommate, or just talk about whatever is going on with you. I’m
                so looking forward to getting to know you!

            <h1> Old Dorm RAs </h1>
            <h2> Jeremy and Chelsea </h2>
            <a href="mailto:Jeremy.Randall@rice.edu"><h4>Jeremy.Randall@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p>
                Chelsea and Jeremy are thrilled to be returning to WRC for year two as RAs in
                the renowned Old Dorm. The newly-ish-weds and their dog (see: daughter),
                a yellow lab named Scout, are excited to offer their support to each Will Rice
                student as they journey through life at Rice University.
            <br><br>
                Chelsea and Jeremy met on a blind date in undergrad at The University of
                Oklahoma. Several months after meeting, Chelsea left the great state of
                Oklahoma to pursue a graduate degree at UT Dallas. The following year
                Jeremy moved south to attend grad school at Texas A&M. After graduating,
                Chelsea moved to Arkansas to begin work at a children’s hospital while
                Jeremy took an internship at Rice. Eventually Chelsea found her way to
                Houston and after several years of long-distance dating, they (finally) got
                married last May. Chelsea works at Texas Children’s Hospital as a speech-
                language pathologist primarily in the neonatal ICU. Jeremy is the athletic
                trainer for the men’s and women’s tennis teams at Rice.
            <br><br>
                In her free time, Chels enjoys reading, baking, and watching the Bachelor. She
                can often be found drinking a glass of cabernet sauvignon while pretending
                to be a sommelier and is always on the hunt for the best bottle of wine $20
                can buy. When not at work, Jeremy enjoys going to Astros games, watching
                documentaries, and loudly singing to ‘90s music. They both spend a large
                amount of time chasing after Scout as she does her best to greet every
                squirrel on campus. Chelsea and Jeremy can’t wait to chat with you during
                “Scout’s Office Hours” and introduce you to all the festivities Will Rice College
                has to offer.

                Sandy is on the faculty in the
                Department of Psychological Sciences and has been hanging around
                Will Rice as an associate for about 8 years. Sandy loves being an RA
                because she can spend even more time with the students over meals,
                musical performances, athletic events, and whatever else they want to
                do. Sandy has monthly study breaks called “StOp and GrOw” where
                we all hang out and take some time to reflect on what we are doing
                and why. Will is a pediatric oncologist at Texas Children’s Hospital and
                Baylor where he is the Deputy Director of Cancer and Hematology.
                <br><br>
                Sandy and Will love poke bowls, bubble tea, chocolate chip cookies,
                and their two English Bulldogs. They can almost always be found
                walking the dogs in the quad after dinner and will talk endlessly
                about their dogs if you are ever at a loss about how to start a
                conversation with them.
