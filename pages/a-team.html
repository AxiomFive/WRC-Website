            <a href="mailto:Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu"><h4>Matthew.Bennett@rice.edu</h4></a>
            <p>Matthew Bennett (Matt) is an associate professor in the Department of Biosciences, where his research in synthetic biology explores the ways in which microbes can be used for medical and industrial applications. Before coming to Rice in 2009, Matt received his PhD in physics from Georgia Tech and did postdoctoral work in bioengineering at UC San Diego. Luckily, his dream girl (Rebekah) married him some years ago and has followed him around all this time. Matt is an avid Detroit Red Wings fan and enjoys poker, gaming, playing cards (euchre), hiking, and crappy science fiction. If you ask his wife, she will say Matt is hyper competitive. If you want to find out for yourself, just challenge him to a game of foosball.
            <br><br>
            Rebekah Bennett is an attorney who attended Emory University and Georgetown Law School. She specializes in labor and employment law, and corporate political activities law. She is currently the General Counsel of the ExxonMobil Pipeline Company.  Rebekah loves baking, movies, travel, and reading.  She also loves to play euchre, but thinks that her husband’s competitive streak needs to be tamed. Rebekah has no idea how to play foosball.
            <br><br>
            Jacob and Marisol Bennett (ages 5 and 2) are the kids. Jacob loves Legos, superheroes, and nature documentaries. Marisol loves anything her older brother is currently playing with. Together, Jacob and Marisol rule the Will Rice College Magister’s house with an iron fist.
            <br><br>
            As magisters, Rebekah and Matt are here to help you. They’ll be around to hang out, provide advice, or simply listen to your concerns. They will be your allies and can help guide you through your time at the university, and provide you with advice both academic and personal.  Matt and Rebekah became magisters because they believe students can benefit from an open-minded, supportive, adult perspective. Their door is always open, and they hope you take advantage of their comfortable sofa and snack stash, whenever you need a break, a friend, or a helping hand.

            <a href="mailto:@email-coordinator"><h4>@email-coordinator</h4></a>
            <p> 
                Hi! I’m Dale, and I’m so pleased to be the new College Coordinator at Will Rice. I
                have been connected to Rice for as long as I can remember and in several
                different ways, including long ago as a Magisters’ kid (at Sid Rich—eek!) and more
                recently as the mom of two Rice undergrads. Professionally, my background is in
                elementary teaching, but I’m excited now to be taking on a different sort of role
                and working with older students (Gods and Goddesses, even).
                <br><br>
                Unlike the rest of the A-Team, I don’t live in the college, so I head home at night
                to whichever of my four big kids happen to be around, our two aloof cats, and
                one crazy-friendly dog. If you were to peek in our windows, you might spy us
                laughing about “The Bachelor,” playing a game, or spontaneously performing a
                song from “Hamilton” in our kitchen. Or we might just be doing the dishes or
                napping on the couch. Anyway, you probably shouldn’t peek in our windows.
                <br><br>
                As the College Coordinator, I’ll likely first encounter you when I issue you your
                room key and soon when you come to pick up packages and other mail from my
                office. Over the course of the year, though, I hope you won’t think of me as “the
                mail lady.” I’m here to help and support you in whatever way you need. Whether
                you’re looking for a vacuum cleaner, directions to your professor’s office, or a
                listening ear, I can probably help—or point you to someone who can. I will also
                be working with students on planning Will Rice events and processing the
                college’s finances.
                <br><br>
                Come by my office anytime to have a piece of candy, relax in the air conditioning,
                or talk about what’s going on with you. I look forward to getting to know you.
                <br><br>

            <p> 
                Tami and Jacob (Jake) are super excited to be RAs and can’t wait to share their enthusiasm for WRC and Rice with you. They are looking forward to supporting you throughout your college experience at Will Rice with their two lovable cats and dog, their plethora of video games, and their home-cooked Italian cuisine.
                <br><br>
                When not at Will Rice, Tami and Jacob can be found at Anderson Hall hanging out with the Archies, where Tami works as the Graphic Designer and Event Coordinator for the Architecture Department and where Jacob studies his way through graduate school for his Masters in Architecture.
                <br><br>
                Before moving to Houston in 2012, this dynamic duo (both originally from the tri-state) met in New Jersey after college when Jacob went in search of a pool table in Jersey City but found the love of his life instead. They bonded over their shared passion for rare and unusual literature and eventually moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico for a few years where Tami received her M.F.A. in Photography at UNM.
                <br><br>
                Tami and Jacob are (almost annoyingly) excited to plan a slew of events to get to know you and let you get to know them. From Pixar Movie Nights to Geocaching picnics, they are here to help make your college experience everything you want it to be by being there for the casual conversation to the ‘I-just-need-to-pet-a-cat-and-watch-amovie- in-order-to-feel-normal’ sort of situations. They are very excited to meet you and know that you’ll love it here at Will Rice!

            <p> 
                Gilbert Cuthbertson is a legendary Will Rice RA, aka Doc C. First of all, Doc is an amazing storyteller, and he has a story for every occasion. Most of his stories are about former Will Rice students - that’s because he’s been involved for more than 50 years! His favorite activities include hunting down bargains, buying things on eBay, being the WRC legendary card shark (bridge and liar’s poker are his personal favorites), teaching his outstanding and entertaining political science classes, schooling freshmen in the gameroom, and greeting Will Rice students with a warm smile and emphatic “No problem!”. You can’t help but be entertained by some of the stories he has to share. Doc is the most pro-Rice and pro-Will Rice person you will meet, so he will do his best as an RA to make your experience at Rice and Will Rice as positive as possible.
