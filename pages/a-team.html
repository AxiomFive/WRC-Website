				<h1> College Magisters </h1>
				<h2> Bridget, Mike, and Frankie </h2>
				<p> Well, think about the Harry Potter analogy: Professor McGonagall is to Gryffindor as Professor Snape is to Slytherin as College Magisters are to Residential Colleges. At Rice, College Magisters are tenured professors and their spouses entrusted with being the faculty leaders of any given college. Along with living next to the college with their families in a magister's house (the Will Rice Magister's House is right next to New Dorm), college magisters help the college to accomplish its shared goals, solve challenges, celebrate its communal achievements, and most of all, be a voice of experience when needed.

				We are lucky enough at Will Rice to have Bridget Gorman and Mike Reed as our magisters. Let's have a look at just how awesome they are:

				Bridget Gorman is professor and chair of the sociology department. She is beginning her 15th year at Rice, and has been actively involved in the residential college system the entire time. She teaches undergrad courses on medical sociology and research methods, and during the day you can often find her in her office, hunkered over a computer and running statistical models for her research. Originally from Seattle, Washington, she has lived all over the country for her studies and research and has amassed a giant collection of board and card games (which you are welcome to borrow). Most importantly, she has mad baking skills, and you will be the fortunate benefactor of her famous cookies.

				Mike Reed is a native Houstonian who received a BA from the University of Houston in literature. He is the owner/operator of a small, niche party rental company, and during the week can often be found working in his office at the magisters' house, playing with Frankie (their nine month old daughter), or walking his two dogs, Steve McQueen and Alabama.

				Bridget and Mike will always lend a helping hand and a listening ear when you need them for advice and assistance with academics, social issues, personal problems, or just life in general. They will assist every student in making the most of the academic and social opportunities available at Rice, and especially Will Rice. Over the coming years, Bridget and Mike will be your allies and guides in planning and preparing your life throughout college and for your world after your Rice years are over.

					        <p>Tami and Jacob (Jake) are super excited to be RAs and can’t wait to share their enthusiasm for WRC and Rice with you. They are looking forward to supporting you throughout your college experience at Will Rice with their two lovable cats and dog, their plethora of video games, and their home-cooked Italian cuisine.<br>
					        <br>	
							When not at Will Rice, Tami and Jacob can be found at Anderson Hall hanging out with the Archies, where Tami works as the Graphic Designer and Event Coordinator for the Architecture Department and where Jacob studies his way through graduate school for his Masters in Architecture.<br>
							<br>
							Before moving to Houston in 2012, this dynamic duo (both originally from the tri-state) met in New Jersey after college when Jacob went in search of a pool table in Jersey City but found the love of his life instead. They bonded over their shared passion for rare and unusual literature and eventually moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico for a few years where Tami received her M.F.A. in Photography at UNM.<br>
							<br>
							Tami and Jacob are (almost annoyingly) excited to plan a slew of events to get to know you and let you get to know them. From Pixar Movie Nights to Geocaching picnics, they are here to help make your college experience everything you want it to be by being there for the casual conversation to the ‘I-just-need-to-pet-a-cat-and-watch-amovie- in-order-to-feel-normal’ sort of situations. They are very excited to meet you and know that you’ll love it here at Will Rice!</p>
