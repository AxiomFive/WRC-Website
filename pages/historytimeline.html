    <!--<p>If you take a little wander through South Campus-the most historic-->
    <!--portion of Rice University's campus-you'll come across a college-->
    <!--that shines like the pyre of a thousand phoenixes illuminated by myth,-->
    <!--power, and value. Congratulations, you have discovered the rust and-->
    <!--gold glory that is Will Rice College, the College of Gods and-->
    <!--Goddesses" and the second college founded at Rice University. You may-->
    <!--first notice that we have a dazzling quad, a quad flanked on three-->
    <!--sides by a spectacular newer dorm of mighty concrete, a stunning-->
    <!--historic old dorm of indestructibly epic architecture, and a cozy-->
    <!--commons of much communal merriment. It's hard to not be impressed by-->
    <!--our college's stature, even before you begin to interact with the Gods-->
    <!--and Goddesses who call Will Rice their home.</p>-->


    <!--<p>We Will Ricers have a common goal in mind-winning. Winning is our-->
    <!--religion and Beer Bike is our Christmas-we are the only college to-->
    <!--have ever swept Beer Bike (meaning that we've placed first in all-->
    <!--three races), not once, but FIVE times. Even when we don't win, we-->
    <!--take pride in putting our best effort forward and striving to be the-->
    <!--best versions of ourselves. We also win at intramural sports on almost-->
    <!--a weekly basis. As you see, we have a reputation of, well, dominating,-->
    <!--which explains why everyone tends to hate on us as a college. But-->
    <!--honestly, you can't blame us for being proud. At our core, we are a-->
    <!--friendly family of a residential college that comes together through-->
    <!--sharing our daily academic enlightenment, intramural sports, parties,-->
    <!--weekly quad celebrations, festive meetings, and of course, by simply-->
    <!--hanging out in the commons, enjoying each other's company, eating the-->
    <!--delicious bounty of East Servery, and talking about our latest plans-->
    <!--to manifest our passions.</p>-->

    <!--<p>We're damn proud of our tradition of excellence. Welcome to Will Rice.</p>-->

    <!--class="text-muted">The One We Were Named After</span></h2>-->
    <!--<div class="people">-->
    <!--<p>In the beginning (the year 1900), William Marsh Rice (Willy) meant to-->
    <!--establish Rice University in his namesake following his death. Then,-->
    <!--Willy was poisoned by Albert Patrick, his evil conspiring butler who-->
    <!--planned to steal Willy's multimillion-dollar fortune, procured, of-->
    <!--course, from being a successful industrial revolution businessman. The-->
    <!--evil Albert Patrick even forged a fake will that deeded Willy's-->
    <!--fortune to Albert Patrick as the beneficiary. Oh no!</p>-->

    <!--<p>But, with the expert help of James A. Baker (Willy's buddy-bro from-->
    <!--work) and William M. Rice Jr. (Willy's nephew, Will Rice!) the true-->
    <!--will (lots of wills!) was resurfaced and carried out, and Mister-->
    <!--Patrick was sentenced to death. After many years, the money that-->
    <!--Albert Patrick tried to steal went toward its original purpose: to-->
    <!--establish the best university in the country, Rice University, in the-->
    <!--year 1912.</p>-->

    <!--<p>Seriously. You can't make this stuff up. It's straight out of a-->
    <!--Western. And if you've ever been on a tour of Rice University, you know-->
    <!--this story.</p>-->

    <!--<p>Anyway, in the late 50s, Rice University decided that the residential-->
    <!--college system would be an amazing idea to implement on its grounds.-->
    <!--So, James A. Baker donated a boatload of money to establish Baker-->
    <!--College (a really crappy college that took up some of the buildings on-->
    <!--campus). No one really cared about that.</p>-->

    <!--<p>It was the year 1957, and by this time, Will Rice was already super-->
    <!--wealthy because he had been involved in the lumber business as well as-->
    <!--being a founder of the Union Bank and Trust Company, president of the-->
    <!--merchants and Planters Oil Company, and director of the Guardian Trust-->
    <!--and Company. Basically, he was smart, sophisticated, snazzy,-->
    <!--accomplished, and a wealthy-as-hell baller. And what do wealthy people-->
    <!--do with their tons of monies? They become philanthropists.</p>-->

    <!--<p>And what better way to spend his money than to establish a residential-->
    <!--college of his very own, at the very educational institution that Will-->
    <!--Rice's uncle established, especially when Will Rice even served on the-->
    <!--Rice University Board of Trustees?</p>-->

    <!--<p>Then Will Rice he said "Let there be Will Rice College!" and he wrote-->
    <!--a check for some tens of thousands of dollars-because back then,-->
    <!--that's all you really needed to establish any given institution.</p>-->

    <!--<p>And then lesser colleges were established by lesser benefactors. No-->
    <!--need to go into detail.</p>-->

    <!--80s and 90s (the rooms in Newer Dorm were referred to by their room number, which corresponded-->
    <!--with their respective staircases) would secede from Will Rice College during changeover and form-->
    <!--Albert Patrick College (Albert Patrick was one of the main evil conspirators involved in the-->
    <!--murder of William Marsh Rice). They would rope off an area of the commons for themselves and not-->
    <!--allow others to sit there. I can only speak from the experience of my freshmen year, but we also-->
    <!--voted APC citizens into faux-office, and everyday our secretaries gave announcements after the-->
    <!--Will Rice secretaries did. After a week or so of this, APC threw a party in order to-->
    <!--symbolize/celebrate their rejoining Will Rice. With Newer Dorm however, everyone faces the quad.-->
    <!--Therefore, no one is indignant enough to secede so the tradition lays dormant... will Albert-->
    <!--Patrick rise again?</p>-->


    <!--<h3>Keg in the Quad</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Fun in the Quad, also called Keg in Quad by some, is a great time for you to meet new people from-->
    <!--your own college. Although other colleges may do similar things, it has become more of a Will-->
    <!--Rice tradition. Almost every Friday afternoon, the college gets together in our quad to just-->
    <!--hang out, talk, and wind down from the hard week. It's a way to vent about whatever papers or-->
    <!--midterms you might have had that week and to also start thinking about the weekend. Usually-->
    <!--their will be music playing from the old dorm kitchen and there will be lots and lots of random-->
    <!--junk food. As mentioned in the name, there is often a keg for those who are of age. But if-->
    <!--you're craving some soda or you're maybe just not 21 yet, there is always something for you to-->
    <!--drink. Keg in the Quad definitely helps form a tight-nit community at Will Rice and is one of-->
    <!--the many reasons why we are such a great college.</p>-->

    <!--<h3>Game Room Challenge Ladder</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Whether we are playing soccer, basketball, flag football, Powderpuff, or really any intramural-->
    <!--sport, we are always competitive. And our competitiveness doesn't stop there or with Beer Bike-->
    <!--either. For many Will Ricers the game room is a second home as there is almost always someone-->
    <!--playing ping-pong, foosball, billiards, or on the Will Rice Arcade. Being as competitive as we-->
    <!--are, we have created ladders for singles and doubles foosball, ping-pong, and pool. The ladders-->
    <!--for each one work the same. To first get on the ladder you must challenge the person who is at-->
    <!--the bottom of the ladder. If you win you get on the ladder and can continue to work your way to-->
    <!--the top where you will achieve ultimate glory and will be feared by everyone else. If you lose,-->
    <!--don't worry&mdash;you can always challenge again after a few days. If you ever want to practice-->
    <!--your Doc shot, French Guillotine shot, or Crab Nebula defense, there most surely will always be-->
    <!--someone in the game room to play with.</p>-->
    <!--<h3> Phoenix Might </h3>-->
    <!--<p>While most residential colleges only have crests, Will Ricers can proudly claim to have both a-->
    <!--crest and a mascot in our beloved phoenix. Although a mere surveyor of Will Rice culture might-->
    <!--mistake the phoenix to serve only as a rallying point, the value (or rather, the myth, power,-->
    <!--and value) of the Will Rice phoenix goes far beyond a simple symbol.</p>-->
    <!--<p>In Greek mythology, when a phoenix would reach the end of its life, instead of dying, it would-->
    <!--seize up in flames and then be reborn of its own ashes. As college students, Will Ricers are-->
    <!--continually undergoing the change from adolescence to adulthood. It is not exactly dying and-->
    <!--being reborn, but getting through college can at times be a trying experience. While we are all-->
    <!--on the road to greatness, that road will have its ups and downs. No one of us Will Ricers is-->
    <!--perfect, but having the value of the phoenix reminds us that no matter our mistakes, when the-->
    <!--Will Rice community stands behind us, we will always have the power to rise from our own ashes-->
    <!--and begin anew.</p>-->


    <!--<h3>Long Hall</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Located on Historic Will Rice's second floor, Long Hall has been home to some of the most-->
    <!--ridiculous moments (and people) from Will Rice history. Traditionally, Long Hall is home to-->
    <!--freshmen and seniors. The doors are always unlocked, and the "Long Hallers" go in and out of-->
    <!--each other's rooms as they please. The Will Rice old dorm kitchen can also be considered a part-->
    <!--of Long Hall. Music is usually playing in the kitchen or on the hall at all hours of the day. If-->
    <!--you want a quiet place to study, stay far away from second floor long! Long Hall is also a great-->
    <!--place to get together with your friends. Long Hall usually throws some kind of party or get-->
    <!--together on the weekends, whether dance parties, movie nights, video games, or other-->
    <!--shenanigans. Don't forget Doc C's birthday party! If you are looking for a good time, head over-->
    <!--to Long Hall!</p>-->

    <!--<h2 class="text-muted"><u>Meal Times</u></h2>-->


    <!--<h3>Lunch Announcements</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Will Rice lunch is very unique. Every weekday during lunchtime, the Will Rice secretaries tell-->
    <!--the college all the happenings in the college and on campus. It is a great time to get together-->
    <!--as a community. In addition, lunch is a great time to count down the days till Beer Bike, Will-->
    <!--Rice's favorite time of the year!</p>-->

    <!--<h3>Post-Meal Hours</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Will Ricers value our meal times in the commons together. It's certainly a tradition to eat as-->
    <!--many meals in our commons with everyone else in the college&mdash;this is the time to catch up-->
    <!--and bond casually as a community. In fact, long after the last of the delicious East Servery-->
    <!--crepe desserts have been devoured, Will Ricers will continue their passionate conversations for-->
    <!--hours at the tables in the commons, especially after dinnertime. These colorful, connecting-->
    <!--conversations will be some of your best memories from Rice&mdash;never hesitate to join in on-->
    <!--them!</p>-->

    <!--<h3>Friday Game</h3>-->
    <!--<p>In the middle of lunch on Fridays, after all announcements, the secretaries will announce the-->
    <!--“Friday game.” You’ll see a few,-->
    <!--somewhat reluctant (but secretly excited), Will Ricers play some ridiculous game that the-->
    <!--secretaries devised, and trust us, they get intense.</p>-->

    <!--<h3>Chug Practice</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Since Will Rice is Will Rice, we start preparing for Beer Bike early - starting during O-week-->
    <!--itself!</p>-->

    <!--<h2 class="text-muted"><u>Winning</u></h2>-->

    <!--<h3>Beer Bike Sweeping/Excellence</h3>-->
    <!--<p>Look anywhere else on this website and it becomes clear that Beer Bike IS Will Rice&mdash;we've-->
    <!--swept five times, and every year, we strive toward the taste of sweet sweepery. Even when we-->
    <!--don't quite sweep, we win at <em>least</em> one (usually two) of the races.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Other colleges get mad/get jealous/get annoyed at us for caring so much about Beer Bike. But-->
    <!--there's a deeper reason behind our care for Beer Bike, that being what it symbolizes: the-->
    <!--pursuit of excellence. How can you be a stellar person if you don't strive to be your best? If a-->
    <!--community believes it is the best, it'll strive to be the best, and then, it'll deliver&mdash;this-->
    <!--is one of our college's core philosophies, and it manifests in Myth, Power, and Value. We train-->
    <!--for weeks, sometimes <em>months</em>, before Beer Bike so that we can be great and feel the-->
    <!--deep-seated satisfaction inherent in putting forth one's best effort.</p>-->
    <!--<p>Other colleges <em>say</em> they're the best, but we're the only ones who SHOW we are the best.-->
    <!--Beer Bike becomes our manifestation of excellence as a college. Will Rice Will Sweep!!!</p>-->


    <!--<h3>Table Dancing</h3>-->
    <!--<p>You will notice that at every Rice party, there will be kids dancing on tables. But these are no-->
    <!--ordinary college students because&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;the kids who <em>always</em> start-->
    <!--up the table dancing are none other than the ballin' Will Ricers. From the first moments of-->
    <!--O-Week, Will Rice freshmen and advisors alike show our dominance above the other colleges during-->
    <!--dance parties. As the year continues during the weekends, Will Ricers have fun dancing above-->
    <!--inferior colleges on sky-high tables. Even during casual lunch times <em>and</em> during-->
    <!--dinnertime festivities of college night celebrations, Will Ricers all win at table dancing. It's-->
    <!--our thing across campus, and we own it.</p>-->
