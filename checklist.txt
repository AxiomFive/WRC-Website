Things to check at the start of each semester:
- That the CSVs for all dynamic pages are up to date:
    - PAAs
    - Fellows
    - STRIVE
    - Student Leadership
    - Caregivers
- That the links in the links configuration file are up to date
- If spring semester, work with the O-Week Coords to update the "New students" page
- If there's a new president, make sure the "Today" page reflects whatever messaging they want to provide
